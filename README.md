# Tik Tak Toe

Created a app that allows for two users to play Tic Tac Toe.

This project challenged me in figuring out how to write in game logic that decided when a user won. As well as creating an element in the DOM for when the correct user clicked a space on the game board.

This project taught me:
- Basic game logic
- DOM manipulation based on user events
